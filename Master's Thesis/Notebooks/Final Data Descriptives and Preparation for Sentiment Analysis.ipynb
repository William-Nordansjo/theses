       "      <td>For Immediate Release\\nChicago, IL â€“ January 27, 2023 â€“ Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Chevron CVX, Kinder Morgan KMI, Agilent Technologies A, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT.\\nThese 3 Companies Can't Get Enough of Their Own Stock\\nStock buybacks, also regularly known as share repurchase programs, are a common strategy we see implemented by companies.\\nThere are several reasons companies elect to buy back their stock; they've decided to utilize excess cash, they want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued.\\nThree companies â€“Chevron,Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies â€“ have all announced repurchase programs in 2023. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.\\nLet's take a closer look at how each one stacks up.\\nChevron\\nChevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program.\\nThe recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase.\\nIn addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings.\\nMost importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings.\\nAnd our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter.\\nKinder Morgan\\nKinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion.\\nAn increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually.\\nImpressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts.\\nAgilent Technologies\\nAgilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\\nOn January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program.\\nAgilent has reported strong results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases. Just in its latest print, the company posted a 10% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 5% above expectations.\\nThe company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.6%. Still, while the yield may be on the lower end of the spectrum, Agilent's 8.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.\\nBottom Line\\nBuybacks have been common in recent years, with titans such as Apple and Microsoft also regularly joining in on the fun.\\nBuybacks send a positive message to investors, indicating that the company is confident in its future prospects.\\nAll three companies above â€“ Chevron, Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies â€“ have recently announced repurchase programs, with investors cheering on the news.\\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

       "      <td>Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 10/3/22, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A), Brixmor Property Group Inc (Symbol: BRX), and Apple Hospitality REIT Inc (Symbol: APLE) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Agilent Technologies, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.21 on 10/26/22, Brixmor Property Group Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.24 on 10/17/22, and Apple Hospitality REIT Inc will pay its monthly dividend of $0.07 on 10/17/22. As a percentage of A's recent stock price of $122.75, this dividend works out to approximately 0.17%, so look for shares of Agilent Technologies, Inc. to trade 0.17% lower â€” all else being equal â€” when A shares open for trading on 10/3/22. Similarly, investors should look for BRX to open 1.31% lower in price and for APLE to open 0.49% lower, all else being equal.\\nBelow are dividend history charts for A, BRX, and APLE, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A):\\nBrixmor Property Group Inc (Symbol: BRX):\\nApple Hospitality REIT Inc (Symbol: APLE):\\nIn general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.68% for Agilent Technologies, Inc., 5.23% for Brixmor Property Group Inc, and 5.92% for Apple Hospitality REIT Inc.\\nIn Thursday trading, Agilent Technologies, Inc. shares are currently down about 0.8%, Brixmor Property Group Inc shares are down about 2.4%, and Apple Hospitality REIT Inc shares are down about 2.9% on the day.\\nClick here to learn which 25 S.A.F.E. dividend stocks should be on your radar screen Â»\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.</td>\n",

       "2  For Immediate Release\\nChicago, IL â€“ January 27, 2023 â€“ Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Chevron CVX, Kinder Morgan KMI, Agilent Technologies A, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT.\\nThese 3 Companies Can't Get Enough of Their Own Stock\\nStock buybacks, also regularly known as share repurchase programs, are a common strategy we see implemented by companies.\\nThere are several reasons companies elect to buy back their stock; they've decided to utilize excess cash, they want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued.\\nThree companies â€“Chevron,Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies â€“ have all announced repurchase programs in 2023. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.\\nLet's take a closer look at how each one stacks up.\\nChevron\\nChevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program.\\nThe recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase.\\nIn addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings.\\nMost importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings.\\nAnd our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter.\\nKinder Morgan\\nKinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion.\\nAn increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually.\\nImpressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts.\\nAgilent Technologies\\nAgilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\\nOn January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program.\\nAgilent has reported strong results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases. Just in its latest print, the company posted a 10% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 5% above expectations.\\nThe company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.6%. Still, while the yield may be on the lower end of the spectrum, Agilent's 8.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.\\nBottom Line\\nBuybacks have been common in recent years, with titans such as Apple and Microsoft also regularly joining in on the fun.\\nBuybacks send a positive message to investors, indicating that the company is confident in its future prospects.\\nAll three companies above â€“ Chevron, Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies â€“ have recently announced repurchase programs, with investors cheering on the news.\\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

(Symbol: A):\\nBrixmor Property Group Inc (Symbol: BRX):\\nApple Hospitality REIT Inc (Symbol: APLE):\\nIn general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.68% for Agilent Technologies, Inc., 5.23% for Brixmor Property Group Inc, and 5.92% for Apple Hospitality REIT Inc.\\nIn Thursday trading, Agilent Technologies, Inc. shares are currently down about 0.8%, Brixmor Property Group Inc shares are down about 2.4%, and Apple Hospitality REIT Inc shares are down about 2.9% on the day.\\nClick here to learn which 25 S.A.F.E. dividend stocks should be on your radar screen Â»\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.  \n",

       "      <td>For Immediate Release Chicago, IL January 27, 2023 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Chevron CVX, Kinder Morgan KMI, Agilent Technologies A, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. These 3 Companies Can't Get Enough of Their Own Stock Stock buybacks, also regularly known as share repurchase programs, are a common strategy we see implemented by companies. There are several reasons companies elect to buy back their stock; they've decided to utilize excess cash, they want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued. Three companies Chevron,Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have all announced repurchase programs in 2023. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Let's take a closer look at how each one stacks up. Chevron Chevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program. The recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase. In addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings. Most importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings. And our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter. Kinder Morgan Kinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion. An increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually. Impressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts. Agilent Technologies Agilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). On January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program. Agilent has reported strong results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases. Just in its latest print, the company posted a 10% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 5% above expectations. The company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.6%. Still, while the yield may be on the lower end of the spectrum, Agilent's 8.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap. Bottom Line Buybacks have been common in recent years, with titans such as Apple and Microsoft also regularly joining in on the fun. Buybacks send a positive message to investors, indicating that the company is confident in its future prospects. All three companies above Chevron, Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have recently announced repurchase programs, with investors cheering on the news.

       "      <td>Title: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Chevron, Kinder Morgan, Agilent Technologies, Apple and Microsoft. Article: For Immediate Release Chicago, IL January 27, 2023 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Chevron CVX, Kinder Morgan KMI, Agilent Technologies A, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. These 3 Companies Can't Get Enough of Their Own Stock Stock buybacks, also regularly known as share repurchase programs, are a common strategy we see implemented by companies. There are several reasons companies elect to buy back their stock; they've decided to utilize excess cash, they want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued. Three companies Chevron,Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have all announced repurchase programs in 2023. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Let's take a closer look at how each one stacks up. Chevron Chevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program. The recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase. In addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings. Most importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings. And our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter. Kinder Morgan Kinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion. An increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually. Impressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts. Agilent Technologies Agilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). On January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program.

       "      <td>The City of London ordered its supplier of space-age trash cans to immediately cease using technology in the bomb-proof bins that collects data from mobile devices of people walking in the capitals Square Mile. Data collection even if it is anonymized needs to stop, the City of London Corp., which acts as the local government authority in the financial district, said today in a statement on its website. The corporation asked supplier Renew to stop collecting data and referred the issue to the Information Commissioners Office, an independent body set up by the U.K. government to enforce data privacy. Renew Chief Executive Officer Kaveh Memari said the reaction to the Orb technology in the Renew Pod bins is understandable, though he defended the technology as merely a glorified counter of people. During our current trials, a limited number of pods have been testing and collecting anonymized and aggregated MAC addresses from the street and sending one report every three minutes concerning total footfall data from the sites, he said in a statement on the companys website . It is very much like a website, Memari said. You can tell how many hits you have had and how many repeat visitors, but we cannot tell who, or anything personal about any of the visitors. Technology in the bins detects smartphones by proximity, speed, duration and manufacturer, London-based Renew said in a June press release. The device has been installed to measure variables in market share between mobile handheld providers within the Citys Square Mile, it said. Shopping Habits The Citys actions came after the Independent newspaper reported that Renews bins are tracking passers-by, intending to study shopping habits in order to target advertising. Irrespective of whats technically possible, anything that happens like this on the streets needs to be done carefully, with the backing of an informed public, the City said in todays statement . The bins, which have LCD screens with public information and advertising, were first installed in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. The trash barrels cost 30,000 pounds ($46,500) each to install, according to the Independent. Further development will depend on people being comfortable with interactive technology, CEO Memari said. The company will discuss additional advancements publicly, he said. A lot of what had been extrapolated is capabilities that could be developed and none of which are workable right now, he said.

       "      <td>LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the Chinese solar-panel maker thats reported eight straight quarterly losses, expects to return to profit this year on domestic demand and as a tariff deal promises better sales in Europe . The company, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 14, started generating positive cash flows from selling wafers used in solar cells in June, President Tong Xingxue said in an interview at his Xinyu office. This is the first time in two years we witnessed obvious improvement, he said. The market is steadily rising and our demand has exceeded supply. The basic barrier to Europe has been overcome and the domestic market is taking off, he said. LDKs debt rose to $2.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter after a supply surplus drove a 20 percent drop in module prices last year. Sales are set to improve after European Union and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement last month to curb EU imports of solar panels in exchange for exempting the shipments from punitive tariffs. The oversupply is easing in 2013 and some top solar manufacturers can even make profits in the second half, Lian Rui, an analyst at NPD Solarbuzz in Beijing, said by phone. The solar market is becoming more diversified, with demand seen in Japan China Europe and Australia, and emerging markets including Africathe Middle East and Thailand , Tong said in the Aug. 8 interview. LDK will have half of its market in Chinawith the rest abroad, Tong said. He expects module prices to increase in the second half. LDKs wafer production is operating at almost full capacity of 4.5 gigawatts from about 30 percent capacity at the beginning of the year, Tong said. The company has kept almost no inventory for the last two quarters, he said. LDK plans to revive production at its polysilicon plants once prices reach at least 140 yuan ($23) a kilogram from about 120 yuan now Tong said. The company also plans to develop 600 megawatts of solar farms this year once it secures buyers, Tong said.

       "      <td>Title: LDK Solar Expects a Return to Profit After EU Trade Deal. Article: LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the Chinese solar-panel maker thats reported eight straight quarterly losses, expects to return to profit this year on domestic demand and as a tariff deal promises better sales in Europe . The company, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 14, started generating positive cash flows from selling wafers used in solar cells in June, President Tong Xingxue said in an interview at his Xinyu office. This is the first time in two years we witnessed obvious improvement, he said. The market is steadily rising and our demand has exceeded supply. The basic barrier to Europe has been overcome and the domestic market is taking off, he said. LDKs debt rose to $2.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter after a supply surplus drove a 20 percent drop in module prices last year. Sales are set to improve after European Union and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement last month to curb EU imports of solar panels in exchange for exempting the shipments from punitive tariffs. The oversupply is easing in 2013 and some top solar manufacturers can even make profits in the second half, Lian Rui, an analyst at NPD Solarbuzz in Beijing, said by phone.

       "      <td>LG Display Co., the worlds second- largest maker of flat screens, rose the most in more than two years after reporting a loss that was smaller than analysts estimates and forecasting a profit this quarter. LG Display gained 6.9 percent to 38,600 won at the close of trading in Seoul, the biggest jump since January 2009. The stock was the third-best performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The maker of liquid-crystal displays for Apple Inc. (AAPL) s i Pad, may post a profit in the second quarter, helped by demand for panels in tablet computers and 3-D TVs, the company said yesterday after announcing its first-quarter results. LG Display aims to supply at least half of all 3-D TVs sold globally this year, betting on demand for its technology. The worst is behind us, Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees $30 billion. As the outlook is expected to improve from the second quarter, investors are scrambling to buy the shares. The company had a net loss of 115.4 billion won ($106 million) in the three months ended in March, LG said yesterday. That compared with an average estimate for a loss of 208.4 billion won in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts before the announcement. Sales fell 8.7 percent to 5.37 trillion won. LG Display may post a profit of 149 billion won in the current quarter and boost that to 549 billion won in the third quarter, according to the average of 18 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. LG Versus Samsung While panels for TVs accounted for less than half the overall sales in the first quarter, falling from 54 percent a year ago, demand for 3-D TVs will help boost profit, Chief Financial Officer James Jeong said. LG aims to account for 50 percent to 70 percent of the 25 million to 30 million 3-D TVs expected to be sold worldwide this year, he said. LG is promoting a technology called Film Patterned Retarder, or FPR, which uses polarized glasses to view 3-D images with visual information sent to both eyes simultaneously. It offers an alternative to the shuttered-glasses approach used by Samsung Electronics Co., which produces a 3-D image by sending visual information to each eye sequentially. LG said its polarized glasses will be lighter and more comfortable to wear, with less eye strain, than shuttered glasses.

       "      <td>Nestle SA (NESN) s intention to wait until 2014 before deciding the future of its LOreal SA (OR) stake may cause investors in the worlds largest food company to worry that it will acquire the cosmetics maker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said. Nestle said April 14 it will decide what to do with its 30 percent LOreal stake in 2014, the year that restrictions on selling the holding to a third party are lifted. Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that makes him slightly more wary that Nestle may bid for the remainder, in a note to clients dated yesterday. The prospect of a value-destroying, risky, strategically inconsistent deal, made against the wishes of most investors, within three years, is hardly going to be forgotten in the meantime, the New York-based analyst wrote. Nestle Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe said taking three years to decide will give the company time to reflect on its strategy. Everyone can relax, Roddy Child-Villiers, head of investor relations at the Vevey, Switzerland-based company, said on April 15. Nestle bought a stake in Paris-based LOreal in 1974 from the Bettencourt family, which still owns about 31 percent. The maker of Kit Kat bars has agreed with LOreals 88-year-old main shareholder, Liliane Bettencourt, not to raise the stake until six months after her death. LOreal has a market value of about 50 billion euros ($71 billion), compared with 181.9 billion Swiss francs ($203 billion) for Nestle. Nestle and the Bettencourt family gave each other a right of first refusal over their stakes that runs through April 29, 2014, according to their agreement. After that, Nestle would be able to sell its stake to a third party without offering it to the Bettencourt family. The food company is probably considering selling the stake or holding it, David Hayes , an analyst at Nomura, wrote in an April 15 note to investors.

       "2       For Immediate Release Chicago, IL January 27, 2023 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Chevron CVX, Kinder Morgan KMI, Agilent Technologies A, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. These 3 Companies Can't Get Enough of Their Own Stock Stock buybacks, also regularly known as share repurchase programs, are a common strategy we see implemented by companies. There are several reasons companies elect to buy back their stock; they've decided to utilize excess cash, they want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued. Three companies Chevron,Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have all announced repurchase programs in 2023. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Let's take a closer look at how each one stacks up. Chevron Chevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program. The recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase. In addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings. Most importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings. And our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter. Kinder Morgan Kinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion. An increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually. Impressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts. Agilent Technologies Agilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). On January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program. Agilent has reported strong results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases. Just in its latest print, the company posted a 10% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 5% above expectations. The company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.6%. Still, while the yield may be on the lower end of the spectrum, Agilent's 8.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap. Bottom Line Buybacks have been common in recent years, with titans such as Apple and Microsoft also regularly joining in on the fun. Buybacks send a positive message to investors, indicating that the company is confident in its future prospects. All three companies above Chevron, Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have recently announced repurchase programs, with investors cheering on the news.

Data collection even if it is anonymized needs to stop, the City of London Corp., which acts as the local government authority in the financial district, said today in a statement on its website. The corporation asked supplier Renew to stop collecting data and referred the issue to the Information Commissioners Office, an independent body set up by the U.K. government to enforce data privacy. Renew Chief Executive Officer Kaveh Memari said the reaction to the Orb technology in the Renew Pod bins is understandable, though he defended the technology as merely a glorified counter of people. During our current trials, a limited number of pods have been testing and collecting anonymized and aggregated MAC addresses from the street and sending one report every three minutes concerning total footfall data from the sites, he said in a statement on the companys website . It is very much like a website, Memari said. You can tell how many hits you have had and how many repeat visitors, but we cannot tell who, or anything personal about any of the visitors. Technology in the bins detects smartphones by proximity, speed, duration and manufacturer, London-based Renew said in a June press release. The device has been installed to measure variables in market share between mobile handheld providers within the Citys Square Mile, it said. Shopping Habits The Citys actions came after the Independent newspaper reported that Renews bins are tracking passers-by, intending to study shopping habits in order to target advertising. Irrespective of whats technically possible, anything that happens like this on the streets needs to be done carefully, with the backing of an informed public, the City said in todays statement . The bins, which have LCD screens with public information and advertising, were first installed in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. The trash barrels cost 30,000 pounds ($46,500) each to install, according to the Independent. Further development will depend on people being comfortable with interactive technology, CEO Memari said. The company will discuss additional advancements publicly, he said. A lot of what had been extrapolated is capabilities that could be developed and none of which are workable right now, he said.

(LDK) , the Chinese solar-panel maker thats reported eight straight quarterly losses, expects to return to profit this year on domestic demand and as a tariff deal promises better sales in Europe . The company, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 14, started generating positive cash flows from selling wafers used in solar cells in June, President Tong Xingxue said in an interview at his Xinyu office. This is the first time in two years we witnessed obvious improvement, he said. The market is steadily rising and our demand has exceeded supply. The basic barrier to Europe has been overcome and the domestic market is taking off, he said. LDKs debt rose to $2.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter after a supply surplus drove a 20 percent drop in module prices last year. Sales are set to improve after European Union and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement last month to curb EU imports of solar panels in exchange for exempting the shipments from punitive tariffs. The oversupply is easing in 2013 and some top solar manufacturers can even make profits in the second half, Lian Rui, an analyst at NPD Solarbuzz in Beijing, said by phone. The solar market is becoming more diversified, with demand seen in Japan China Europe and Australia, and emerging markets including Africathe Middle East and Thailand , Tong said in the Aug. 8 interview. LDK will have half of its market in Chinawith the rest abroad, Tong said. He expects module prices to increase in the second half. LDKs wafer production is operating at almost full capacity of 4.5 gigawatts from about 30 percent capacity at the beginning of the year, Tong said. The company has kept almost no inventory for the last two quarters, he said. LDK plans to revive production at its polysilicon plants once prices reach at least 140 yuan ($23) a kilogram from about 120 yuan now Tong said. The company also plans to develop 600 megawatts of solar farms this year once it secures buyers, Tong said.

LG Display gained 6.9 percent to 38,600 won at the close of trading in Seoul, the biggest jump since January 2009. The stock was the third-best performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The maker of liquid-crystal displays for Apple Inc. (AAPL) s i Pad, may post a profit in the second quarter, helped by demand for panels in tablet computers and 3-D TVs, the company said yesterday after announcing its first-quarter results. LG Display aims to supply at least half of all 3-D TVs sold globally this year, betting on demand for its technology. The worst is behind us, Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees $30 billion. As the outlook is expected to improve from the second quarter, investors are scrambling to buy the shares. The company had a net loss of 115.4 billion won ($106 million) in the three months ended in March, LG said yesterday. That compared with an average estimate for a loss of 208.4 billion won in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts before the announcement. Sales fell 8.7 percent to 5.37 trillion won. LG Display may post a profit of 149 billion won in the current quarter and boost that to 549 billion won in the third quarter, according to the average of 18 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. LG Versus Samsung While panels for TVs accounted for less than half the overall sales in the first quarter, falling from 54 percent a year ago, demand for 3-D TVs will help boost profit, Chief Financial Officer James Jeong said. LG aims to account for 50 percent to 70 percent of the 25 million to 30 million 3-D TVs expected to be sold worldwide this year, he said. LG is promoting a technology called Film Patterned Retarder, or FPR, which uses polarized glasses to view 3-D images with visual information sent to both eyes simultaneously. It offers an alternative to the shuttered-glasses approach used by Samsung Electronics Co., which produces a 3-D image by sending visual information to each eye sequentially.

Bernstein said. Nestle said April 14 it will decide what to do with its 30 percent LOreal stake in 2014, the year that restrictions on selling the holding to a third party are lifted. Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that makes him slightly more wary that Nestle may bid for the remainder, in a note to clients dated yesterday. The prospect of a value-destroying, risky, strategically inconsistent deal, made against the wishes of most investors, within three years, is hardly going to be forgotten in the meantime, the New York-based analyst wrote. Nestle Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe said taking three years to decide will give the company time to reflect on its strategy. Everyone can relax, Roddy Child-Villiers, head of investor relations at the Vevey, Switzerland-based company, said on April 15. Nestle bought a stake in Paris-based LOreal in 1974 from the Bettencourt family, which still owns about 31 percent. The maker of Kit Kat bars has agreed with LOreals 88-year-old main shareholder, Liliane Bettencourt, not to raise the stake until six months after her death. LOreal has a market value of about 50 billion euros ($71 billion), compared with 181.9 billion Swiss francs ($203 billion) for Nestle. Nestle and the Bettencourt family gave each other a right of first refusal over their stakes that runs through April 29, 2014, according to their agreement. After that, Nestle would be able to sell its stake to a third party without offering it to the Bettencourt family.

The peso rose 0.5 percent to 1,790.32 per U.S. dollar at 11:16 a.m. New York time, from 1,799.01 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,788.84, the strongest level since Oct. 13. The currency has jumped 4.7 percent in the past month, the second- best performance after the Brazilian real among 25 emerging- market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Strong FDI flows have been coming in, especially in the last two to three weeks, said Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the countrys second-biggest bank. The higher dollar inflows have increased the dollar cash positions of financial intermediaries, according to Perez. Colombian regulations dont allow banks to have negative dollar positions. You dont have that technical constraint that was helping limit gains in the peso, he said. The yield on the nations 10 percent bonds due July 2024 was little changed at 8.27 percent, according to Colombia s stock exchange. The bonds price fell 0.035 centavo to 113.592 centavos per peso.

       "2       Title: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Chevron, Kinder Morgan, Agilent Technologies, Apple and Microsoft. Article: For Immediate Release Chicago, IL January 27, 2023 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Chevron CVX, Kinder Morgan KMI, Agilent Technologies A, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. These 3 Companies Can't Get Enough of Their Own Stock Stock buybacks, also regularly known as share repurchase programs, are a common strategy we see implemented by companies. There are several reasons companies elect to buy back their stock; they've decided to utilize excess cash, they want to limit dilution caused by employee stock option programs, or simply because they believe their shares are undervalued. Three companies Chevron,Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have all announced repurchase programs in 2023. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Let's take a closer look at how each one stacks up. Chevron Chevron is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. Yesterday, the company announced a sizable $75 billion share repurchase program. The recent surge in energy prices has benefitted the company in a big way; CVX reported free cash flow of a steep $12.3 billion in its latest quarter, good enough for a 16% sequential uptick and an 84% Y/Y increase. In addition, the company's dividend is in decent shape, currently yielding 3.2% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 33% of its earnings. Most importantly, the company is scheduled to release quarterly results tomorrow, January 27th, before the market open. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.16 suggests a 62% Y/Y increase in earnings. And our consensus revenue estimate stands firm at $52.3 billion, suggesting an improvement of nearly 9% from the year-ago quarter. Kinder Morgan Kinder Morgan is a leading midstream energy infrastructure provider in North America. Earlier in the year, KMI increased its previously authorized $2 billion stock buyback to $3 billion. An increase in energy prices has helped Kinder Morgan increasingly reward its shareholders; KMI's dividend payout grew nearly 3% over the last year, currently yielding a steep 6% annually. Impressively, last year marked the fifth consecutive year of increased payouts. Agilent Technologies Agilent is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of a broad-based portfolio of test and measurement products serving multiple end markets. Currently, the company sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). On January 9th, Agilent approved a fresh $2 billion share repurchase program. Agilent has reported strong results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by double-digit percentages in back-to-back releases. Just in its latest print, the company posted a 10% EPS beat and reported sales nearly 5% above expectations. The company does pay a dividend, currently yielding a modest 0.6%. Still, while the yield may be on the lower end of the spectrum, Agilent's 8.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap. Bottom Line Buybacks have been common in recent years, with titans such as Apple and Microsoft also regularly joining in on the fun. Buybacks send a positive message to investors, indicating that the company is confident in its future prospects. All three companies above Chevron, Kinder Morgan and Agilent Technologies have recently announced repurchase programs, with investors cheering on the news.

Below are dividend history charts for A, BRX, and APLE, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Symbol: A): Brixmor Property Group Inc (Symbol: BRX): Apple Hospitality REIT Inc (Symbol: APLE): In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.68% for Agilent Technologies, Inc., 5.23% for Brixmor Property Group Inc, and 5.92% for Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. In Thursday trading, Agilent Technologies, Inc. shares are currently down about 0.8%, Brixmor Property Group Inc shares are down about 2.4%, and Apple Hospitality REIT Inc shares are down about 2.9% on the day.

Article: The City of London ordered its supplier of space-age trash cans to immediately cease using technology in the bomb-proof bins that collects data from mobile devices of people walking in the capitals Square Mile. Data collection even if it is anonymized needs to stop, the City of London Corp., which acts as the local government authority in the financial district, said today in a statement on its website. The corporation asked supplier Renew to stop collecting data and referred the issue to the Information Commissioners Office, an independent body set up by the U.K. government to enforce data privacy. Renew Chief Executive Officer Kaveh Memari said the reaction to the Orb technology in the Renew Pod bins is understandable, though he defended the technology as merely a glorified counter of people. During our current trials, a limited number of pods have been testing and collecting anonymized and aggregated MAC addresses from the street and sending one report every three minutes concerning total footfall data from the sites, he said in a statement on the companys website . It is very much like a website, Memari said. You can tell how many hits you have had and how many repeat visitors, but we cannot tell who, or anything personal about any of the visitors. Technology in the bins detects smartphones by proximity, speed, duration and manufacturer, London-based Renew said in a June press release. The device has been installed to measure variables in market share between mobile handheld providers within the Citys Square Mile, it said. Shopping Habits The Citys actions came after the Independent newspaper reported that Renews bins are tracking passers-by, intending to study shopping habits in order to target advertising. Irrespective of whats technically possible, anything that happens like this on the streets needs to be done carefully, with the backing of an informed public, the City said in todays statement . The bins, which have LCD screens with public information and advertising, were first installed in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. The trash barrels cost 30,000 pounds ($46,500) each to install, according to the Independent. Further development will depend on people being comfortable with interactive technology, CEO Memari said. The company will discuss additional advancements publicly, he said. A lot of what had been extrapolated is capabilities that could be developed and none of which are workable right now, he said.

Article: LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the Chinese solar-panel maker thats reported eight straight quarterly losses, expects to return to profit this year on domestic demand and as a tariff deal promises better sales in Europe . The company, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Aug. 14, started generating positive cash flows from selling wafers used in solar cells in June, President Tong Xingxue said in an interview at his Xinyu office. This is the first time in two years we witnessed obvious improvement, he said. The market is steadily rising and our demand has exceeded supply. The basic barrier to Europe has been overcome and the domestic market is taking off, he said. LDKs debt rose to $2.9 billion as of the end of the first quarter after a supply surplus drove a 20 percent drop in module prices last year. Sales are set to improve after European Union and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement last month to curb EU imports of solar panels in exchange for exempting the shipments from punitive tariffs. The oversupply is easing in 2013 and some top solar manufacturers can even make profits in the second half, Lian Rui, an analyst at NPD Solarbuzz in Beijing, said by phone. The solar market is becoming more diversified, with demand seen in Japan China Europe and Australia, and emerging markets including Africathe Middle East and Thailand , Tong said in the Aug. 8 interview. LDK will have half of its market in Chinawith the rest abroad, Tong said. He expects module prices to increase in the second half. LDKs wafer production is operating at almost full capacity of 4.5 gigawatts from about 30 percent capacity at the beginning of the year, Tong said. The company has kept almost no inventory for the last two quarters, he said. LDK plans to revive production at its polysilicon plants once prices reach at least 140 yuan ($23) a kilogram from about 120 yuan now Tong said. The company also plans to develop 600 megawatts of solar farms this year once it secures buyers, Tong said.

Article: LG Display Co., the worlds second- largest maker of flat screens, rose the most in more than two years after reporting a loss that was smaller than analysts estimates and forecasting a profit this quarter. LG Display gained 6.9 percent to 38,600 won at the close of trading in Seoul, the biggest jump since January 2009. The stock was the third-best performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The maker of liquid-crystal displays for Apple Inc. (AAPL) s i Pad, may post a profit in the second quarter, helped by demand for panels in tablet computers and 3-D TVs, the company said yesterday after announcing its first-quarter results. LG Display aims to supply at least half of all 3-D TVs sold globally this year, betting on demand for its technology. The worst is behind us, Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees $30 billion. As the outlook is expected to improve from the second quarter, investors are scrambling to buy the shares. The company had a net loss of 115.4 billion won ($106 million) in the three months ended in March, LG said yesterday. That compared with an average estimate for a loss of 208.4 billion won in a Bloomberg survey of 12 analysts before the announcement. Sales fell 8.7 percent to 5.37 trillion won. LG Display may post a profit of 149 billion won in the current quarter and boost that to 549 billion won in the third quarter, according to the average of 18 analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg. LG Versus Samsung While panels for TVs accounted for less than half the overall sales in the first quarter, falling from 54 percent a year ago, demand for 3-D TVs will help boost profit, Chief Financial Officer James Jeong said. LG aims to account for 50 percent to 70 percent of the 25 million to 30 million 3-D TVs expected to be sold worldwide this year, he said. LG is promoting a technology called Film Patterned Retarder, or FPR, which uses polarized glasses to view 3-D images with visual information sent to both eyes simultaneously. It offers an alternative to the shuttered-glasses approach used by Samsung Electronics Co., which produces a 3-D image by sending visual information to each eye sequentially.

Article: Nestle SA (NESN) s intention to wait until 2014 before deciding the future of its LOreal SA (OR) stake may cause investors in the worlds largest food company to worry that it will acquire the cosmetics maker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said. Nestle said April 14 it will decide what to do with its 30 percent LOreal stake in 2014, the year that restrictions on selling the holding to a third party are lifted. Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that makes him slightly more wary that Nestle may bid for the remainder, in a note to clients dated yesterday. The prospect of a value-destroying, risky, strategically inconsistent deal, made against the wishes of most investors, within three years, is hardly going to be forgotten in the meantime, the New York-based analyst wrote. Nestle Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe said taking three years to decide will give the company time to reflect on its strategy. Everyone can relax, Roddy Child-Villiers, head of investor relations at the Vevey, Switzerland-based company, said on April 15. Nestle bought a stake in Paris-based LOreal in 1974 from the Bettencourt family, which still owns about 31 percent. The maker of Kit Kat bars has agreed with LOreals 88-year-old main shareholder, Liliane Bettencourt, not to raise the stake until six months after her death. LOreal has a market value of about 50 billion euros ($71 billion), compared with 181.9 billion Swiss francs ($203 billion) for Nestle. Nestle and the Bettencourt family gave each other a right of first refusal over their stakes that runs through April 29, 2014, according to their agreement. After that, Nestle would be able to sell its stake to a third party without offering it to the Bettencourt family.

Article: Colombias peso climbed to a six- month high on increased foreign direct investment flows and speculation funds from abroad will continue to flow into the South American country. The peso rose 0.5 percent to 1,790.32 per U.S. dollar at 11:16 a.m. New York time, from 1,799.01 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,788.84, the strongest level since Oct. 13. The currency has jumped 4.7 percent in the past month, the second- best performance after the Brazilian real among 25 emerging- market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Strong FDI flows have been coming in, especially in the last two to three weeks, said Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the countrys second-biggest bank. The higher dollar inflows have increased the dollar cash positions of financial intermediaries, according to Perez. Colombian regulations dont allow banks to have negative dollar positions. You dont have that technical constraint that was helping limit gains in the peso, he said. The yield on the nations 10 percent bonds due July 2024 was little changed at 8.27 percent, according to Colombia s stock exchange. The bonds price fell 0.035 centavo to 113.592 centavos per peso.
